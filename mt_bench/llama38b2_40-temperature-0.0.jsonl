For example, the probability of getting heads on the first coin 0.5 the probability of getting heads on the second coin0.5 probability of getting heads on both coins 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25\n* **Dependent Events**: When two events are dependent, the probability of one event affecting the other.

This is in contrast to classical physics, where a particle can only be in one definite state.\n\nTo illustrate this concept, imagine a coin. physics, a coin can either be heads or tails, but in quantum physics, the coin can exist in a superposition of both heads and tails at the same time. It's as if the coin is in a state of \"both\" until it's observed or measured, at which the superposition collapses, and the coin becomes either heads or tails.\n\nNow to relate superposition to quantum entanglement, entanglement is a phenomenon particles in connected in such a way that their properties become correlated, regardless of the distance between them. When two particles are entangled, their properties, such as spin, with each other means properties of one particle are linked to the properties of the other particle.\n\nHere's where superposition comes in: when two entangled particles are in a superposition of states, their properties become correlated in a way that, well, superposition.
